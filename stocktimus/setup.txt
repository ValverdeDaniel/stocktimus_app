🔧 How to Activate Your "stocktimus" Virtual Environment
============================================================

📍 Option 1: Using Anaconda Prompt (Recommended)
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Open Anaconda Prompt

2. Navigate to your project folder (adjust path if needed):
   cd C:\Users\Daniel2\OneDrive\Desktop\devprojects\shadowstocks\stocktimus

3. Activate the virtual environment:
   stocktimus\Scripts\activate

✅ You should now see:
   (stocktimus) C:\Users\Daniel2\OneDrive\Desktop\devprojects\shadowstocks\stocktimus>



------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Test the environment:
------------------------------------------------------------
Run this command:
   python manage.py runserver

If successful, you’ll see a message like:
   "Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/"

You're now ready to build!



-----------------------------------------------------------

open command line not powershell

C:\Users\Daniel2\OneDrive\Desktop\devprojects\shadowstocks\stocktimus\frontend>npm start

 GIT BRANCHING & MERGING CHEAT SHEET
========================================

### PHASE 1: CREATE A NEW BRANCH ###

# Goal: Create a new branch based on the most up-to-date version of 'main'.

# 1. Go to your main branch
git checkout main

# 2. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
git pull origin main

# 3. Create your new branch and switch to it (-b creates the branch)
git checkout -b <your-new-branch-name>


### PHASE 2: DO YOUR WORK ON THE NEW BRANCH ###

# Goal: Make changes and save them in commits on your new branch.
# This is a loop: Edit -> Add -> Commit. Repeat as needed.

# 1. Make your changes (edit, create, or delete files).

# 2. Check the status of your changes
git status

# 3. Add the files you want to save to the staging area
# (Use a specific file name or '.' to add all changes)
git add <file-name>
git add .

# 4. Commit your staged changes with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Your descriptive message for this change"


### PHASE 3: PREPARE TO MERGE ###

# Goal: Push your branch to the remote and get 'main' ready for the merge.

# 1. Push your new branch to the remote repository ('origin')
# (The -u flag sets the upstream link for future pushes)
git push -u origin <your-new-branch-name>

# 2. Switch back to the main branch
git checkout main

# 3. Pull the latest changes on main one more time
# (This is important in case others have merged work while you were on your branch)
git pull origin main


### PHASE 4: MERGE AND PUSH ###

# Goal: Merge your feature branch into main and update the remote repository.

# 1. Merge your branch into main (you must be on 'main' to do this)
git merge <your-new-branch-name>

# ** If you get MERGE CONFLICTS: **
#    a. Open the conflicted files listed in the terminal.
#    b. Edit them to resolve the differences (remove the '<<<<<', '=====', '>>>>>' markers).
#    c. Stage the resolved files: git add <file-name>
#    d. Commit the merge: git commit -m "Fix merge conflicts"

# 2. Push the newly merged main branch to the remote repository
git push origin main


### PHASE 5: CLEAN UP ###

# Goal: Delete the feature branch now that its work is complete.

# 1. Delete the local branch
# (-d is a safeguard that only works if the branch has been merged)
git branch -d <your-new-branch-name>

# 2. Delete the remote branch (optional, but good practice)
git push origin --delete <your-new-branch-name>
